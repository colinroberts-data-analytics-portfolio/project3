# Project Description
The NIH (National Institute of Health), in an effort to be better prepared for the next pandemic, has commissioned a study looking into the factors that influenced COVID spread and mortality.                
The ask is for their team of analysts to visualize how COVID spread affected different populations of countries around the world, with population density and vaccination rates being factors.                           
Also, the NIH has asked for an analysis of COVID mortality in these countries, along with those visualizations,                  
and for the team to draw data-based conclusions that might allow us to be better able to withstand the impact of another pandemic.
